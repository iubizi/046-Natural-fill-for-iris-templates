046 Natural fill for iris templates

All data are desensitized (the template has no iris information. The iris is generated by the diffusion model and does not contain raw biological data)

## Data processing(merge) method

- Read pictures and exclude files that are not pictures (return)
- Resize images of different sizes to the same size uniformly, resize interpolation method: bicubic interpolation
- Align the iris and fill in the transparent template area
- Use the pupil from the template to cover the empty space in the middle of the iris
- Use different Gaussian Blur templates to cover sharp edge areas and make the whole image look natural.
